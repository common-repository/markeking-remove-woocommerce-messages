Removes messages that you want from WooCommerce.

== Description ==

A **super-lightweight** plugin to remove Woocommerce messages.

You can choose which messages you want to hide.

You can delete any message you want. You can remove for example "Product Successfully Added to Cart " message, "Have a coupon? Click here to enter your code" and any other messages, notices or error messages.

Of course we talk about information messages, error messages and ok messages shown at the top of the screen.

How does it work?
You can enter prohibited in your control panel phrases. Any message that itself contains WooCommerce that phrase will be blocked and will not be shown

It is very easy, but there are certain things you should know about how the plugin works. I recommend you visit our website for complete instructions, examples and more!:
